        I’m Jesse Pena, an Army veteran and a software developer. I've always enjoyed working with computers and I’ve been interested in learning how to code since I learned that students were using R for statistical analysis for ecology research projects. I developed quantitative reasoning skills from my studies in ecology. Ideally, I'd like to use my skills to help develop code that helps people find  joy and/or success in their lives. That can be through creating an entertaining game, simplifying a tedious task, or helping them organize their life.

        I hope that the work I find coding will be emotionally and intellectually fulfilling. I believe that a career in software development will help me create  a better life for my loved ones.

        I’ve learned that coding is team based. I am a strong team member. I’m adaptable and  willing to change. I know how to follow and I know how to lead others. I've been in a supervisory role in most of my jobs, including my most recent job as consulting utility forester. I’ve also been a supporting team member as well. I believe my success as a leader and team member has been a result of my strong communication skills and attention to detail.

        I've been coding since February of this year and completed a program at Code Fellows in Seattle. There I worked with JavaScript, Python, HTML, and CSS. I'm currently enrolled at PDX Code Guild and taking their evening full-stack developer bootcamp to keep my skills sharp. I take ownership of my work, I'm optimistic, and I'm always willing to learn. You want me on your team.
