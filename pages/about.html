    <p class='about_me_p'>
        I’m Jesse Pena, an Army veteran and a software developer. I've always enjoyed working with computers and I’ve been interested in learning how to code since I learned that students were using R for statistical analysis for ecology research projects. I developed quantitative reasoning skills from my studies in ecology. Ideally, I'd like to use my skills to help develop code that helps people find  joy and/or success in their lives. That can be through creating an entertaining game, simplifying a tedious task, or helping them organize their life.  
    </p>
    <p class='about_me_p'>
        I hope that the work I find coding will be emotionally and intellectually fulfilling. I believe that a career in software development will help me create a better life for my loved ones. 
    </p>
    <p class='about_me_p'>
        I’ve learned that coding is team based. I am a strong team member. I’m adaptable and  willing to change. I know how to follow and I know how to lead others. I've been in a supervisory role in most of my jobs, including my most recent job as consulting utility forester. I’ve also been a supporting team member as well. I believe my success as a leader and team member has been a result of my strong communication skills and attention to detail. 
    </p>
    <p class='about_me_p'>
        I've been coding since February 2020 year and I've completed two coding bootcamps. The first was Code Fellows in Seattle and the second was PDX Code Guild in Portland. I've worked with JavaScript, Python, HTML, and CSS. I've worked with various frameworks including Django, React, NextJs, and VueJS. I've deployed applications through Heroku and Digitcal Ocean. I am familiar with Git and navigating files with Ubuntu. I take ownership of my work, I'm optimistic, and I'm always willing to learn. You want me on your team.
